> **Partly superseded (2026-07-18).** The Lua/SwiftUI membrane was set aside with 🎯T9/T11/T12; the direction is the generative web surface (🎯T29). Layering ideas (repo defaults vs user scripts) may return there.

# Lua as a Unified Programmable Membrane

## Observation

The server-side Lua runtime (gopher-lua in Go) and the client-side Lua
runtime (C Lua in iOS) are not two separate systems. They are two
execution sites for a single logical layer — the programmable boundary
between state and presentation.

View scripts define the contract: given this state, produce this UI.
Where those scripts run is an optimisation decision, not an
architectural one.

## Current State

- **Server**: gopher-lua renders view trees from state, streams JSON
  to client. Used during development and as fallback.
- **Client**: C Lua 5.1.5 runs the same scripts locally against
  replicated state (via sqlpipe). Target architecture for production.
- **Scripts**: identical Lua source, same builder functions, same
  state access patterns.

The pivot from server-side to client-side rendering (🎯T9) is really
about moving execution within the membrane, not changing the membrane
itself.

## Design Constraint

All Lua state access must go through declared data dependencies:

- `query(sql)` — read from the local sqlpipe replica.
- `subscribe(sql)` — declare a live dependency; re-render when
  underlying data changes.

No side channels (direct HTTP calls, global variables, ambient state).
If a script accesses state only through these functions, its execution
location becomes a deployment decision:

| Data lives on... | Script runs on... | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Client replica | Client | No round-trip needed |
| Server only | Server | Data isn't replicated |
| Both | Either | Optimise for latency |

This constraint is cheap to maintain and keeps the option open for
automatic placement later without building infrastructure now.

## Practical Implications

1. **Don't specialise scripts by location.** A view script shouldn't
   know or care whether it runs on the server or the client. If you
   find yourself writing `if server then ... end`, the data dependency
   isn't properly declared.

2. **Keep the builder API identical.** Both runtimes must expose the
   same set of builder functions (`text`, `vstack`, `hstack`,
   `padding`, etc.). Divergence breaks location transparency.

3. **Jevons writes scripts, not locations.** When the AI agent modifies
   a view script, it writes Lua. It doesn't decide where that Lua
   runs. The runtime handles placement.

4. **Two runtimes is fine for now.** gopher-lua and C Lua implement
   the same Lua 5.1 semantics. Unifying them into a single runtime
   isn't necessary — what matters is that the scripts are portable
   between them.

## Future Possibilities

If the membrane thickens beyond views (event handlers, data transforms,
validation rules), the same principle applies: write the logic once,
declare its data dependencies, let the runtime place it. This is not
a priority, but the constraint above keeps the door open.

### Self-improving UI

Jevons can edit Lua scripts at runtime via `jevons_reload_views`. This
creates two tiers of improvement:

- **Lua-only changes** (layout tweaks, new screens, style changes) —
  take effect immediately via script push. No app rebuild. These can
  be committed to the repo and ship to all users in the next release.
- **Swift-level changes** (new primitives, renderers, gestures) —
  require an app rebuild. Jevons can write the code but it needs to be
  built and deployed.

The more expressive the Lua primitives, the more Jevons can improve
without touching Swift. Each time a Swift change is needed to support
a Lua feature (e.g. `bottom_inset`), that's a signal that the
primitive set should be expanded.

Script versioning (🎯T12) provides rollback for broken changes.
The control channel and `exec_lua` MCP tool give Jevons direct access
to the client runtime for diagnostics and ad-hoc fixes.

**Open question:** When a product update ships improved base scripts,
users who have customised their scripts (directly or via their Jevon)
face a merge conflict. The product wants to deliver improvements; the
user wants to keep their customisations. No solution designed yet —
noted here so it isn't forgotten.

### Longer-term vision

The logical endpoint is a single relational expression over the entire
system — `(state, event) → (state, action)` — where an optimiser
splits the expression across client/server boundaries automatically,
monitoring traffic patterns and adaptively restructuring the flow.
sqlpipe becomes an execution strategy, not an API.

Prior art: `arr-ai/arrai` (Marcelo's earlier project) was a
relational/functional language with set-based semantics intended to
go in this direction. The ambition stalled but the thinking is
relevant. See also: Naiad/Differential Dataflow, Dedalus/Bloom,
CALM theorem.

Parked — not actionable for jevons now, but the `subscribe(sql)`
constraint preserves the option.
